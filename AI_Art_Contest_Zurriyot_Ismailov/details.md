5.	prompt used:
- Positive: Create an alternative album cover for Eminem's 'Encore' with a modern, surreal twist. Instead of the original theater curtain and spotlight scene, place Eminem alone on a futuristic digital stage, surrounded by holographic imagery of his past albums and lyrics floating in the air. The color scheme should be dark blue and silver, with dramatic lighting casting deep shadows. Eminem should wear a sleek black suit, looking introspective. The word 'ENCORE' should appear in bold, glitch-style typography at the top, maintaining a sense of grandeur and finality. The mood should be intense, reflective, and iconic — capturing the theme of a final bow or last performance in a digital age.
- Negative: No cartoon or anime style, no distorted facial features, no low resolution, no overly bright or saturated colors, no cluttered background, no duplicate faces or limbs, avoid graffiti or street-style fonts, no smiling expressions — maintain a serious, reflective tone.

5.	prompt used:
- Positive: Design an alternative movie poster for Interstellar with a minimalist yet emotionally powerful aesthetic. Show a lone astronaut standing on the edge of a distant planet, gazing up at a swirling wormhole in the sky, which subtly resembles a clock. Use a cold, desaturated color palette — deep space blues, blacks, and soft whites — to evoke loneliness and wonder. Incorporate abstract shapes that hint at time dilation and gravity. The title 'INTERSTELLAR' should be centered at the bottom in sleek, serif typography, with a faint glow. The mood should feel epic, contemplative, and visually vast — conveying the film’s core themes of time, space, and human connection
- Negative: Avoid cartoonish or comic book styles, no anime influences, no bright neon colors, no cluttered or chaotic scenes, no crowded cast displays, no smiling characters, no Earth landscapes, no vintage or retro sci-fi aesthetics, avoid cheesy space clichés like aliens or lasers, no low-quality textures or pixelation — maintain a clean, cinematic, and emotionally serious tone.
