<h1>Welcome to the Generative AI Course: Lecture 1 Recap</h1>

<p>Our journey into the fascinating world of Generative AI has officially begun! In our first lecture, we explored the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), the structure of the course, and some important logistical details. Here's a detailed recap of the main points discussed during the session.</p>

<h2>The Course Overview</h2>

<p>Our tutor, Vitaliy (Speaker 8), kicked off the session by introducing the course and sharing his extensive background in AI and software development. With over 13 years in IT and a strong focus on education, Vitaliy is well-equipped to guide us through the intricacies of generative AI. Here's what we can expect from the course:</p>

<div class="highlight">
    <ul>
        <li>A comprehensive look at AI and ML, including Large Language Models (LLMs).</li>
        <li>Hands-on experience with Python and related AI tools.</li>
        <li>Understanding of foundational and state-of-the-art models.</li>
        <li>Practical tasks, culminating in a Capstone project.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Understanding AI and ML</h2>

<p>Vitaliy explained the differences between AI, ML, and their subfields. Here are some key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>AI (Artificial Intelligence):</strong> Encompasses systems that mimic human intelligence, performing tasks such as decision-making and problem-solving.</li>
    <li><strong>ML (Machine Learning):</strong> A subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> A type of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to process data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Vitaliy introduced us to tools like <code>TensorFlow</code> and <code>PyTorch</code>, which are popular frameworks for developing machine learning models. He recommended PyTorch due to its prevalence in current AI projects.</p>

<h2>Course Logistics</h2>

<p>Vitaliy outlined how practical tasks and assessments will be conducted. Students are encouraged to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use Python for coding tasks due to its extensive library support.</li>
    <li>Submit assignments via a GitHub repository.</li>
    <li>Engage with home tasks promptly for timely feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>The course will not have traditional exams; instead, your understanding will be evaluated through practical assignments and a Capstone project. The grading scale is based on a percentage system, with practical tasks and the Capstone project contributing to your final mark.</p>

<h2>Key Topics and Practical Work</h2>

<p>The course will cover a range of topics, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>LLMs and their applications</li>
    <li>API interactions using Python</li>
    <li>Image and audio generation</li>
    <li>Ethical considerations and security in AI</li>
</ul>

<p>Practical work will involve using GitHub for version control and collaboration. Students are encouraged to fork the provided repository and submit their work there.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As we embark on this exciting journey, remember that the world of AI is rapidly evolving. This course is designed to not only provide you with foundational knowledge but also to inspire you to explore the vast possibilities that AI offers. Stay curious, engage actively, and let's make the most of this learning experience together!</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you all in the next session!</p>
